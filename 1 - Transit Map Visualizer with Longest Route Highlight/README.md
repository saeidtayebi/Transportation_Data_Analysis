# Transit Map Visualizer with Longest Route Highlight

This Python project allows you to visualize transit data from GTFS files on a map and highlight the longest route on the map. It utilizes the pandas, geopandas, and folium libraries to process and display the data.

## Requirements
To use the application, you will need to install the following libraries:

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* geopandas
* folium

## Usage
* Download the GTFS files for the transit system you want to visualize and place them in the same directory as the __transitmap_longestroute.py__ file.

* Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the __transitmap_longestroute.py__ file.

* Run the command python __transitmap_longestroute.py__.

* The program will prompt you to enter the name of the GTFS file. Enter the name of the file (including the .zip extension).

* The program will process the data and open a web browser window displaying the transit map with the longest route highlighted in blue.
