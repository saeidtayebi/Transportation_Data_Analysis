# Analyzing and Visualizing Trends in TTC Bus Delays for 2022 Insights on Location, Time, and Incidents

This project analyzes Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) bus delay data for the year 2022 using Python and popular data analysis libraries. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns and trends in delay times across different locations, times of day, and causes of delay. The insights gained from this analysis can inform TTC service improvements and enhance the overall experience for TTC passengers. The following analysis are presented: 
<br>
1. Trends in TTC bus delays by month
2. Top 5 TTC bus delay locations in 2022 by total delay time (in hours)
3. Top 3 most contributing incidents for the top 5 locations with the highest delays.
4. Daily trend for TTC bus delays 
5. The average bus delay time per day across all locations in 2022
