# Report on Pedestrian Safety Trends
<br>
aproject that is designed to summarize trends and patterns in pedestrian collisions in the City of Toronto, considering factors leading to pedestrian collisions, and factors leading to serious and fatal injuries when pedestrians are involved in a collision.This project has different parts that each focus on a different question.

## Dependencies: 
1. pandas
2. matplotlib

You can install these packages using the following command in your terminal:

``` !pip install pandas matplotlib ``` 

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system as well.

## Part I - Analysis of Pedestrian Collisions and Injuries over the Last 10 Years

In this part we want to answer these two questions:

* Has the rate of pedestrian collisions increased or decreased over the last 10 years?
* Has the severity of injuries changed over this time period?

Outputs 1 and 2 are what I obtained when using this dataset while answering these questions.

## Part II - Pedestrian Safety Analysis: Mid-block vs. Intersection Crossings and Vehicle Maneuver Risks
<br> 
In this part we want to answer these two questions: 
* Is it more dangerous for a pedestrian to cross mid-block or at an intersection? 
* At an intersection, are right-turning or left-turning vehicles more dangerous for pedestrians?


Outputs 3 and 4 are what I obtained when using this dataset while answering these questions.

## Part III - District-wise Analysis of Pedestrian-Involved Collisions

In this part we want to answer these two questions: 
* What parts of the City (by district) are most dangerous for pedestrians? 
* In what region of the City is a pedestrian collision most likely to result in a fatality or serious injury?

Outputs 5 and 6 are what I obtained when using this dataset while answering these questions.

## Part IV - Age Group Analysis of Pedestrians with Fatal or Major Injuries

In this part we want to answer these two questions: 
* Are older pedestrians more likely to be killed or seriously injured in a collision than other age groups?
* Are older (65+) pedestrians more likely to be involved in a collision than other age groups?

Outputs 7, 8 and 9 are what I obtained when using this dataset while answering these questions.
